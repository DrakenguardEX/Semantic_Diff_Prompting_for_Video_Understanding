    "The image shows a kitchen sink made of stainless steel. Inside the sink, there is some residual water and a few droplets are visible on the sink surface. In front of the sink, there is an orange and white mug that is partially filled with water. The mug has some text on it, but it is partially cut off and not fully readable. To the left, there is a glimpse of a can, possibly being poured into the mug. The overall setting appears to be a typical kitchen area.",
