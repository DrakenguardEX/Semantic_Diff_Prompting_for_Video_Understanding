    "This frame shows a close-up view of a clear plastic cup placed inside a sink. Water is being poured into the cup from above, causing bubbles and some splashing. The cup is situated on a textured surface, likely a drying mat or a sink liner. The lighting is warm and reflects off the metal surface of the sink. On the right side of the frame, part of a pot or pan with condensation on its inside surface is visible.",
    "This frame shows a close-up view of a clear plastic cup placed in a sink. Water is being poured or flowing into the cup from above. The cup is sitting on a textured mat inside the sink. To the right side of the frame, part of a dark-colored, rounded object is visible, possibly a bowl or a pot. The lighting suggests the image was taken indoors, with some reflections visible on the metallic surface of the sink.",
    "This frame shows a clear plastic cup being filled with water from a stream or faucet. The cup is placed inside a sink or basin, with water splashing inside it. To the side, there is a dark-colored object, possibly a pot or pan. The background is metallic, indicating a kitchen or washing area environment. The water is visibly flowing and splashing inside the cup.",
    "The frame shows a clear plastic container or cup placed in a kitchen sink. Water is being poured into the container from above, creating a flow that appears slightly frothy or bubbly. The container is situated on a patterned or textured tray or mat inside the sink area. To the right, there is a dark-colored object that might be a pan or pot. The sink itself has a metallic finish.",
    "The image shows a clear plastic container being filled with water from a faucet. The container is placed inside a metal sink with a textured bottom surface. The water is flowing into the container, causing bubbles and some splashing. To the side of the container, there is a darker object, possibly a bowl or another container. The lighting is warm and creates a shiny reflection on the metal sink.",
    "This frame shows a clear plastic cup positioned upside down under a stream of water flowing from a faucet. The cup is placed in a sink with a textured surface underneath it to allow water drainage. To the right of the cup, there is a dark-colored, possibly round object resting in the sink. The overall setting appears to be a kitchen or utility sink area.",
    "This image shows a transparent cup being filled with water under a running tap in a kitchen sink. The cup is placed on a textured surface within the sink, and the water is visibly splashing as it fills the cup. There is also a dark-colored object, possibly a pot or pan, partially visible on the right side of the image. The lighting creates a reflective and slightly shiny appearance on the metal sink surface.",
    "This frame shows a close-up view of a glass or transparent container filled with water, placed in a kitchen sink. The water is bubbling vigorously, creating a frothy surface on top of the glass, likely due to air or agitation causing bubbles. The scene appears to be taken inside a sink with metallic surroundings, and there is another object on the right side, partially visible, possibly another dish or container. The overall lighting is dim with a warm tone."
