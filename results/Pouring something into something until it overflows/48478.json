    "The frame shows two cups on a dark, granite countertop. One cup is black and being held by a hand, while the other cup is white with an orange handle and is empty, placed on the surface. The image captures a moment that seems to be just before pouring or filling one cup with the contents from the other.",

    "In the current frame, water is being poured from the black container into the white cup with an orange handle. The cup, previously empty, is now partially filled with water.",
    "In the current frame, the liquid being poured from the container into the cup has increased in volume, filling the cup more than in the previous frame.",
    "In the current frame, more liquid is being poured from the metal container into the cup, with the stream of liquid visibly longer and closer to the cup.",
    "In the current frame, more water has been poured into the mug, causing the water level inside the mug to rise compared to the previous frame.",
    "The liquid being poured from the metal container into the mug is splashing and spilling over the rim of the mug in the current frame.",
