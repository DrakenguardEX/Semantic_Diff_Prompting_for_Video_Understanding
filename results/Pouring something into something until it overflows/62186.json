    "This image shows a close-up view of a hand pouring milk or cream from a small container into a white cup placed on a dark wooden surface. The cup already contains some liquid, and the pouring is creating a swirling effect inside the cup. The overall setting suggests preparation of a beverage like coffee or tea with milk or cream.",
    "The image shows a close-up of a hand pouring a white liquid from a small container into a white cup placed on a dark brown wooden surface. The liquid appears to be milk or cream. The hand holding the container is positioned above the cup, and the liquid is mid-pour, creating a visible splash inside the cup.",
