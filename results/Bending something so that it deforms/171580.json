    "The frame shows a portion of a beige or light-colored wall with a white electrical outlet on the lower right side. There is part of a dark object or shadow in the lower left corner, and a few fingers are visible at the top left, seemingly reaching downwards or holding something. The overall composition is minimal, focusing mostly on the wall surface.",
    "This frame shows a close-up of a hand with fingers partially curled, positioned near the upper center of the image. The background is a plain, light-colored wall with a white electrical outlet or switch panel visible towards the bottom right corner. The edge of a dark object is visible along the left side of the frame. The overall image appears to be taken indoors.",
    "This frame shows a close-up of a hand holding a clear, flexible plastic tube or hose. The background features a plain, light-colored wall with a white electrical outlet or switch plate visible near the bottom right corner. The image has a simple and ordinary indoor setting.",
    "The image shows a close-up of a hand holding a transparent, flexible ruler that is bent into an arc shape. The ruler has measurement markings along its length. In the background, there is a beige-colored wall and a white electrical outlet or switch cover. The focus is on the ruler and the hand grasping it, suggesting an action involving measuring or demonstrating the ruler's flexibility.",
    "This frame shows a close-up of two hands holding and stretching a piece of clear, flexible material. The background is a plain beige wall, and there is a white electrical outlet partially visible on the right side of the image. The material being stretched appears to be thin and transparent, possibly a piece of plastic or silicone.",
    "The frame shows a close-up of two hands holding and bending a flexible, transparent ruler with measurement markings on it. The ruler is being curved into a semi-arc shape. In the background, there is a beige wall and a white electrical outlet or switch panel visible. The scene appears to be indoors with neutral lighting.",
    "This frame shows two hands holding a flexible, transparent tube. The tube appears to have some liquid or bubbles inside it. The background is a plain beige wall with a white electrical outlet or switch plate visible on the right side. The scene looks like it might be related to plumbing or some kind of liquid transfer.",
    "The frame captures a section of a beige or light-colored wall with a white electrical outlet or switch plate positioned towards the bottom right corner. A hand is visible near the top left corner, holding a transparent object that appears to be a ruler or a similar measuring tool aligned horizontally. The image is slightly tilted."

  "diff_texts": [
    "Initial frame. No previous frame to compare.",
    "The hand has moved slightly upward and to the right in the current frame compared to the previous one.",
    "In the current frame, the hand is more extended and is now holding a flexible, translucent tube or strip that was not present in the previous frame. The tube is bent upwards, indicating motion as it is being lifted or moved.",
    "The main object, a transparent flexible ruler, has been bent further upwards and to the right compared to the previous frame. The hand holding the ruler has adjusted its grip slightly to accommodate this increased bend.",
    "The flexible ruler has straightened out slightly, changing from a more curved shape to a gentler, less pronounced curve.",
    "The main object, a transparent ruler, has been bent more sharply in the current frame compared to the previous one. The ends of the ruler are pulled closer together, increasing the curvature.",
    "The ruler is being bent further, increasing its curve in the current frame compared to the previous one.",
    "The main object, a flexible tube or cable, has straightened out and is now held more horizontally compared to the previous frame where it was bent in an arch shape."
