    "The image shows a wooden table with a small card placed on it. A person's hand is reaching toward or touching the card. The card has a colorful circular design on it. In the background, there is a white wall with a window or light source creating some bright spots on the surface. A floor lamp with a white lampshade is visible near the wall. The setting appears to be indoors with minimal furniture or objects visible.",
    "The image shows a wooden table with a light brown finish. A person wearing a brown, long-sleeved sweater is reaching towards or placing an object on the table. The arm and hand of the person are slightly blurred, indicating motion. In the background, there is a white wall with a window, a white lamp on a stand, and part of a framed picture or poster. The scene appears to be inside a well-lit room.",
    "The image shows a person's arm in a brown ribbed sweater reaching toward a wooden table. The table has a light wood finish and is clear of any objects. In the background, there is a white wall with a tall, slim lamp standing beside the table. Sunlight is coming through a window, casting some light and shadow on the wall. The scene appears to be indoors, possibly in a study or workspace.",
    "The frame shows a person wearing a brown ribbed sweater, sitting or standing next to a wooden table. The person is holding or folding a square piece of white paper on the table. In the background, there is a white lamp with a blue stand and a window with blinds, letting in some light. The room appears to be simple and well-lit.",
    "This frame shows a person with a brown sweater extending their hands over a wooden table. The focus is on their hands, which appear to be handling or arranging something small on the table, possibly cards or small pieces of paper. The background includes a white wall, a floor lamp, and part of a framed picture or poster on the right side. The lighting is natural, coming from the left side of the image.",
    "The image shows a wooden table with a person's blurred hands in motion over it. On the table, there is a small folded white paper. In the background, part of a lamp with a white lampshade and a window with blinds can be seen. The setting appears to be indoors with good natural lighting.",
    "The image shows a mostly empty wooden table with a small folded paper object, possibly a paper airplane or a paper boat, placed near the center. In the background, there is a white wall with a window letting in light, and next to the window, a tall, white floor lamp is visible. The scene appears to be in a minimalist indoor setting with natural light coming in.",
    "The image shows a wooden table with a small white paper item, possibly a folded piece of paper, placed on it near the center. In the background, there is a light-colored wall with a window partially visible, allowing some natural light to enter the room. On the left side of the image, there is a black and white desk lamp with a round shade, and to the right side, part of a white or light-colored object is visible, but it is unclear what it is. The overall setting appears to be a simple, well-lit indoor space, possibly an office or a workspace."
