    "Initial frame. No previous frame to compare.",
    "The thumb and index finger have moved slightly closer together, pinching the top corner of the paper more tightly. The top corner of the paper is bent a bit further upward.",
    "The hand has folded the top right corner of the paper further inward compared to the previous frame.",
    "The hand has lifted the upper corner of the paper higher, causing the paper to bend more noticeably compared to the previous frame.",
    "The main change is that the hand is pulling the corner of the paper further up and away from the surface, increasing the fold and lifting the paper higher.",
