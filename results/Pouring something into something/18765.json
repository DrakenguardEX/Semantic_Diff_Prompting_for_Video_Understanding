    "Initial frame. No previous frame to compare.",
    "The glass on the left side of the frame moved closer to the empty wine glass on the table, partially entering the frame in the current image.",
    "The measuring cup is now tilted, pouring liquid into the glass, which remains in the same position.",
    "In the current frame, the liquid level in the measuring cup has decreased as some liquid has been poured into the glass, which now contains a small amount of liquid. The measuring cup is tilted more compared to the previous frame.",
    "In the current frame, liquid is being poured into the glass, and the liquid is swirling and splashing inside the glass.",
    "The water being poured into the glass has stopped, and the glass is now full with the water settled.",
    "The measuring cup has moved away from the glass and is now tilted backward, no longer pouring water into the glass. The water level in the glass remains the same as in the previous frame.",
    "The water glass has been moved slightly to the right and closer to the camera."
