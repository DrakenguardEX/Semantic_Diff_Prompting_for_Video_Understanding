    "The image shows a purple glass with an embossed Coca-Cola logo placed upside down on a white towel with black stripes. In the background, there is a large red container or bucket. Water is being poured into the glass from above, but since the glass is upside down, the water appears to be filling the space under the glass or being deflected. The towel underneath likely serves to catch any spilled water.",
