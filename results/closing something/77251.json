    "The image shows a close-up view of a hand reaching toward or about to grasp the handle of a white door with a frosted or textured glass window pane. The background includes a metal fence or screen, and the door appears to be an exterior door, possibly leading outside or to another area. The person’s wrist is visible, wearing a black wristband or bracelet, and part of a tattoo on the forearm can be seen. The lighting suggests it's daytime.",
    "This frame shows a close-up view of a person's left hand holding the handle of a white door with a frosted or textured glass panel. The person is wearing a black wristband or smartwatch, and there is a tattoo visible on their forearm. The scene appears to be taken from the perspective of the person about to open the door. The door is set in a white frame, and the background outside the door is not clearly visible.",
    "The image shows a close-up view of a person's arm and hand reaching to grasp the handle of a white door. The door has a frosted glass window with vertical textured patterns, and the person's arm appears to have a tattoo on the forearm. The setting seems to be indoors or at an entryway, with a bit of an outdoor area visible through the glass or beyond the door.",
    "The frame shows a close-up view of a hand gripping the handle of a white door. The door has a frosted glass window panel. The person appears to be wearing a black wristband or watch on their left wrist. There is some light coming from behind the door, which seems to be indoors.

    "The frame shows a close-up view of a hand reaching for or holding the handle of a white door. The door has a frosted glass window that obscures the view through it. Part of the floor and a small section of a room are visible on the left side of the image, with an indistinct object or possibly a pet partially visible near the bottom left corner. The person appears to be wearing a dark wristband or watch on their wrist. The angle of the shot suggests that the viewer is positioned behind the person opening or closing the door.",
    "This frame shows a close-up view of a person's hand gripping the handle of a door. The door has a frosted glass pane in its upper half, which obscures the view of the other side. The person appears to be in the act of opening or closing the door. The image is slightly blurry, suggesting motion.",
    "This frame shows a close-up view of a door with a frosted glass panel. There is a hand reaching towards or holding the door handle on the left side of the image. The frosted glass appears semi-transparent, with some blurred shapes or objects visible behind it. The lighting suggests it might be daytime. The image is slightly blurred or out of focus.",
    "The image shows a close-up of a hand reaching out towards a door handle. The door has a frosted glass panel that obscures the view beyond it, allowing light to pass through but making objects behind it blurry and indistinct. The scene appears to be indoors, with the hand in the foreground and the door being the primary focus of the frame."

    "Initial frame. No previous frame to compare.",
    "The main object, a hand, has moved from being open and reaching toward the door frame to grasping the door handle. The action indicates the person is in the process of opening the door.",
    "The hand has moved slightly closer to the door handle, beginning to grasp it. The angle of the arm has shifted a bit as it reaches for the handle.",
    "The door has been pushed open slightly in the current frame compared to the previous one. The hand on the door handle has moved forward as if pulling the door.",
    "The door is slightly more open in the current frame compared to the previous one. The hand on the door handle has moved forward as the door is being pushed or pulled open.",
    "The door is being opened further, with the hand pulling the handle inward, moving the door from a more closed position to a more open position.",
    "The hand has moved slightly downward while gripping the door handle, and the door handle itself has rotated downward.",
